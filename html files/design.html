              Home: for this page I used a Spline 3D creation I created myself,
              as I wanted the website to link towards the idea of asteroids, I
              incorporated something minimal and that looks like asteroids
            </p>
            <p>
              About: For this page as seen in the wireframes I wanted to add
              more of my asteroid elements here, however it clashed with the
              text I intended to display about my site, so I decided to not go
              with it while trying to figure out a way to move around it so that
              it may be incorporated into the next deployment version of my
              site.
            </p>
            <p>
              Data-art: This page is left blank for a reason – rubric requires
              it to be blank.

            </p>
            <p>
              Blog: For the blogs section I made a normal page section wherein
              you can select which blog you would like to go into, and within it
              are two sections that open up and display the blogs in full and on
              their own instead of having all of them displayed on one page
              which forces the reader to go through them all instead of picking
              which one they would like to see.
            </p>
            <p>
              Design: this page was kept simple, just displaying my wireframes
              and text such as this for the user viewing to understand my reason
              for design choices.

            <p>
              Aestheticand Layout: For this I wanted to keep it very minimal and
              simple. I did not want to do too much as that can overpower the
              website and make it much difficult for the viewer to engage along
              with feeling drawn to the website.
            </p>

            <p>
              Font: The font I use throughout my entire website was ‘Lara’ font.
              I love how minimal it is, however, I am open to expanding on it by
              using other fonts for other headings, but only if I find one that
              is visually appealing to my website and me.
            </p>

            <p>
              Colour Scheme: As seen from most of the information along with
              digital art interactions displayed the colour scheme for this is
              shades of grey. The reason as to why I used shades of grey is to
              represent the asteroids and their colour, another reason being, I
              want my data visualisations and art to match the colour scheme of
              my website, however I need to first structure my data out and
              figure the colour scheme I intend to use there before I decide on
              one.

          <article class="paragraph">
            <p>
              Home: for this page I initially used a Spline 3D creation I
              created myself, however from the feedback received in the first
              assignment, my creation did not display as it mentioned that I
              needed to add something to it. After which I found a way to
              incorporate a spline design as it requires the design to be static
              instead of moving. The only problem with using a spline design is
              the loading time for it has not been imported as a normal image.
            </p>
            <p>
              About: For this page, I changed my whole idea of how I wanted it
              to be displayed, as I incorporated more colour and blocks
              separating the two information instead of having it just be
              separated without having people being able to differentiate
              between the two.
            </p>
            <p>
              Data-art: In this section, I have decided to incorporate a feature
              that lets the user decide on what date they would like to see data
              on, and it will automatically generate the information after they
              have chosen the date and selected the generation key. I wanted to
              create a giant circle/orbit with asteroids on them to create a
              data artwork, however, I created only orbits with different
              colours, I want the first orbit being the smallest to have the
              lightest colour with the last orbit being the largest to have the
              darkest colour. Thereafter when you hover over the orbit you will
              get the information about it, the smallest orbit represents the
              asteroid closest to Earth and the largest represents the asteroid
              furthest from Earth. In the recent artwork (being the second one),
              I decided to create an artwork that represents network art. For
              this I wanted the lines to display the distance between each
              asteriod, however due to my api being very limited, I could not
              add that feature.
            </p>
            <p>
              Data-visual: In this wireframe section, I have decided to
              incorporate a feature that lets the user decide on what date they
              would like to see data on, and it will automatically generate the
              information after they have chosen the date and selected the
              generation key. So as the user enters there will be nothing but
              after they generate one, two data visualizations will appear in
              different graph formats. One will display data regarding the
              diameter of the asteroid (in metres) and the other the distance of
              the asteroid from earth (in megametres). Furthermore, I have added
              the updaed visuals of the wireframes and what kind of graph I
              would like to create for my thrid graph - which is an interactive
              graph.
            </p>
            <p>
              Blog: For the blogs section, I kept it like my initial blogs,
              however I added images to make it look more interesting and
              aesthetically pleasing. Furthermore, I worked on how information
              in the blog sections were displayed, I made them stand out more
              compared to the background while making necessary changes to the
              various font sizes and removing ‘br’ tags that were used to create
              space.
            </p>
            <p>
              Design: this page was kept the same as it just displayed my
              wireframes and text such as this for the user viewing to
              understand my reason for design choices. However it was modified
              to look much better than before. This section also includes my
              previous wireframes and their notes along with the new updated
              ones.

              Aesthetic and Layout: As previously mentioned, I wanted to keep
              the layout and aesthetics of my website very minimal, however
              seeing that previous on was too pink, i made it grey and link more
              to Asteriods.
            </p>
            <p>
              Font: The font I use throughout my entire website was ‘Lara’ font,
              which has not changed. I love how minimal it is and plan to
              continue using it.
            </p>
            <p>
              Colour Scheme: The colour scheme I have chosen to go with is
              shades of grey with hints of pink, purple and blue in the visuals
              of my data art and data visuals pages. Therefore breaking away
              from the pink I had in my website initially, as I was told it does
              not show the theme of the NASA API.
