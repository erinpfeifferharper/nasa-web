          <h3>critical reflection on data driven art</h3>
          <article class="paragraph">
            <p>The combination of data, creativity, and technology in the field of data-driven art offers up new avenues for creative expression and communication. The term Data Art or Data Driven Art is a form of artistic expression that uses a dataset to evoke feelings from the viewer (Benzi, 2020). As Data Art is based on data, the primary medium of these works are the datasets that are used for creating visual, auditory, or interactive works of art. Therefore, in this critical reflection I will be reflecting upon the use of representation and communication within my Data Driven Artwork. With that in mind, how to effectively communicate the artist's message, representation and communication are crucial. To convey an artist's vision and produce a powerful piece of art, it is crucial to think about how the dataset may be altered. It's also critical to consider the context and message that the artwork is attempting to portray.</p>
            <p>As established before, my website is based on the NASA API known as ‘Asteroid NeoWs’ (NASA Open APIs, no date), wherein it can be seen to provide information about asteroids that are seen to orbit close to earth. Now that the context of what my website is meant to be about has been set, let's take a critical look at planning, reflection, and communication for the Data Driven Artwork.</p>
            <p>To formulate this critical analysis of my website, I will be guided by the following points:
                <li>Artistic Intent and Objectives</li>
                <li>Creation Process</li>
                <li>Engagement with the Data Set</li>
                <li>Enhancement or Subversion of Meaning</li>
                <li>New Perspectives on Data</li>
                <li>Theoretical Framework</li></p>
            <p>Artistic Intent and Objective:
                For this data driven artwork I was inspired by the website ‘Eyes on Asteroid’ (https://www.jpl.nasa.gov, no date) which allows you as the viewer to view thousands of asteroids and comets in real-time, track the next five near-Earth encounters, and investigate historical, current, and upcoming asteroidal and comet expeditions. The Centre for Near Earth Object Studies (CNEOS) at JPL (Jet Propulsion Laboratory), which supports NASA's Planetary Defence Coordination Office by computing high-precision orbits for Near-Earth Objects (NEOs), is the source of the data used in this interactive display (Eyes on Asteroids - NASA/JPL, no date).
                </p>
            <p>Therefore after looking at this website (see Figure One) I knew what I wanted to achieve, which was the placement of the orbits around the Sun, however given the API I used within my website it would be related to it, which would have orbits around Earth, wherein each orbit can be seen to represent each asteroid. Thereafter I found a simpler version to help with trying to integrate this as a reference (see Figure Two). As the first version is more interactable and allows the player to zoom in and zoom out, the second one is more static.</p>
            <p>Creation Process:
                Moving on to the creation process of my Data Driven Artwork, it did not come out exactly like Figure One or Two, as those are works that can be seen to have has plenty of time spent on it or the creator of those works are more advanced than myself. For starters, my work was done in codepen.io (CodePen, no date) so that I could test it out as I go along without worrying about changes added to my CSS and HTML section affecting my code. 
                </p>
            <p>Engagement with the Data Set:
                When it comes to how my Data Art engages with my Data Set, it can be seen through the hover feature that I have implemented, so that when the viewer hovers over the asteroid orbit they are able to get information on the orbit. The orbits are created in the way that the smallest orbit represents the closets asteroid to Earth and the largest orbit represented the furthest asteroid from Earth. However the only thing with this is the colours utilised as I am trying to implement more colours into the set, but I want the colours to be warm or cool and the closest being the lightest and the furthest being the darkest. 
                </p>
            <p>Enhancement or Subversion of Meaning: 
                With my data artwork, I feel that I adds to the meaning of my website due to it portraying various orbit lines, which represent a different asteroid around Earth, just as we find our planets on different orbit lines around the Sun. Additionally, the artwork exhibits energy and motion, which is crucial to the overall design of my website. I think the artwork makes the website more fascinating and engaging overall and contributes to its overall experience.
                </p>
            <p>New Perspectives on Data:
                Therefore with that in mind, I feel that it allows the viewer to think differently about orbit lines compared to how we normally would, in terms of it representing what was mentioned before. different angle that is more imaginative and receptive to new interpretations thanks to this new viewpoint. It enables us to think about facts in new ways and to break free from our preconceived assumptions and preconceptions.
                </p>
            <p>Theoretical Framework:
                Furthermore, when we look at what Data art is, it can be seen to have the following characteristics:
                <li>Data as a medium </li>
                <li>Visualisation</li>
                <li>Storytelling</li>
                <li>Interactivity </li>
                <li>Aesthetic qualities </li>
                <li>Technology </li>
                <li>Etc.</li>
                Therefore, when analysing my work in terms of these characteristics, I can say that I have to some extent incorporated these values and if not, I have tried to portray them in some way to the viewer. 
                </p>
            <p>Within this Data Driven Artwork, I feel that it embodies a merging of artistic intention, creative methodology, and data interaction. Although it is not as complex as the designs, I gained my inspiration from, I personally believe I great and it is unique to my website. Essentially, it shows how data-driven art can be a potent tool for drawing people in and questioning traditional interpretations of the data, offering a fresh and diverse form of artistic expression and communication.</p>
