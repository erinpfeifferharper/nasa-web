          <h3>critical reflection on ui and ux design </h3>
          <article class="paragraph">
            <p>
              The link between users and technology are of critical importance in the digital age. With that we as users want to enjoy these various forms of technology without exhausting our minds trying to navigate through them. Therefore, two fundamental concepts are formed, they are known as User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX). UI refers to the appearance of the interface and what characteristics it contains, whereas UX refers to the experience of the user when engaging with this interface. (Oleksandr, no date) The digital landscapes that we interact with are shaped by these two concepts and a perfect combination of the two results in an aesthetically appealing interface and enjoyable user experience. Furthermore with the above concepts mentioned, I will be analysing my first prototype website by writing a critical reflection on the UI and UX design while relating it to the sources provided to me along with any additional information. 
            </p>
            <p>To begin, my website for this assignment was inspired by the NASA API (Application Programming Interface) known as ‘Asteroids – NeoWs’ (NASA Open APIs, no date) This API provides data and information about Near Earth Objects (NEOs), specifically asteroids that are seen to orbit close to Earth. Wherein these objects are significant as they are what pose potential threats that is important for scientists, researchers, and space enthusiasts to know. Now that the background has been established on what my website is supposed to have about let us critically examine it. </p>
            <p>To form this critical reflection of my website, here are a few points that I will using to guide me, they are the following:	Purpose and Intent 
              First Impressions,
              Design and Aesthetics, 
              Content, 
              Usability and Navigation, 
              Responsiveness,
              Personal Growth and Learning.
              </p>
              <p>As mentioned above, the purpose of my website is to use the NASA API to display data (which will be done in the second prototype) . As that is my primary purpose, I feel that my content and design do align with that, especially when we look at the way it was structured. For the homepage has a 3D representation of asteroids in the form of 3D circles with not too much in the background that can appear to be overpowering. Which we see Knaflic mentions in his book on ‘Storytelling with Data’, that cluster is one’s enemy, for it allows something to take up space yet it serves no purpose being there as it does not increase understanding. (Knaflic, 2015)</p>
              <p>When it comes to the first impression that the users gets as they enter my website, I want them to get the feel that is about asteroids through the visuals portrayed, unfortunately this is not the case with the published version of my website, the viewers are unable to see the 3D animation of asteroids that I created in spline, as I must have imported it incorrectly when I pushed it to git hub, for when I was working on it before, it displayed exactly how I wanted it to be displayed with the correct colour scheme – which is grey, as asteroids are assumed to be grey in colour. With my spline design not appearing, my website makes use of a lot of white space, not only on the homepage buy everywhere, as it is my idea of keeping the website very minimal, as I don’t like a cluttered webpage. This idea of incorporating white space as mentioned to be one of seven elements of an aesthetically pleasing website allows the users to focus on what is important (‘7 Elements of an Aesthetically Pleasing Website’, 2011) which is what I try my best to bring across to the viewer. </p>
              <p>Furthermore, seeing that the colour scheme was shades of grey. As I mentioned in my design  style guide it was decided upon so that it can link towards the idea of asteroids, however, seeing that the following task requires the use of data visualisation, I plan to incorporate some colour as the shades of grey seem a bit bland for the website. As colour is one of the most important visual tools that influence the way the user gains experience from the website. (‘7 Elements of an Aesthetically Pleasing Website’, 2011) I made use of the same font that I utilised in my previous project for it brings across that minimal idea, and the fact that I love pretty fonts. </p>
              <p>When diving into the content section of my website, I would say that it is relevant to the website, for if we tackle the about page it informs the user about what it entails, and it is very detailed but short – as it gets straight to the point. Moreover when we touch on the navigation and usability of the website, everything is placed accordingly so that users can find the information easily, without struggling to find anything they need. Further website navigation is important as it can influence the users feelings and increase their visitation duration on the site.(Website Navigation: Definition, Importance and Tips | Indeed.com, no date)</p>
              <p>The design approach that proposes that design and development should adjust to user behaviour and surroundings based on screen size, platform, and orientation is what we define as Responsive web design. (Responsive Web Design: What It Is And How To Use It) As we know with any website you design it is key for it to be important as your users need to be able to access it from any device – particularly one of the three being mobile, tablets and pc. Therefore we can see that is the case with mine, however there are areas wherein the responsive feature is not perfect such as the headings and navigation bar on mobile, as it appears to occupy a much larger space than required, this can be prevented by me working on my code and figuring out what I need to improve on so that my website is fully responsive. </p>
              <p>From creating my website what are some key things that I can say I have learnt is the importance of UI and UX for this is what makes or breaks a website. Furthermore is that one needs to make sure that the elements incorporated work, do not push to git last minute as you will not be able to determine if your website works or not, in my case this happened with spline component. </p>
              <p>UI and UX are what shape the digital landscapes we navigate through daily. Whereby a perfect combination of the two are seen to guarantee a not only aesthetically pleasing interface but one in which the users find enjoyable and smooth. Therefore it is important to not only analyse other users’ websites but look back and reflect upon ones own for it allows you to pick up thinks you never though about while creating along with being honest with yourself. </p>
