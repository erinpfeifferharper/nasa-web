          <h3>data visualisation</h3>
          <article class="paragraph">
          <p>
            In the digital age, data visualisation has emerged as a useful tool, transforming raw and complex data into aesthetically appealing information. In this critical reflection, we will be analysing the reading by Li, titled ‘Overview of Data Visualisation’ through which the author presents a comprehensive overview of data visualization, highlighting its significance, techniques, and applications in today's data-driven world whilst providing our own interpretation as to what we feel about the reading and how it relates to us. 
          </p>
          <p>Before diving into the critical reflection of this reading let us start by defining what the term ‘data’ means. Data is seen to be a collection of information that is obtained by observations, measurements, study, or analysis. (What is Data? Classification of Data - Qualitative and Quantitative, no date) The data processed is not recognised to have any sort of meaning that affiliates with it, hence where data visualisation comes in. ‘Data visualisation’ is the graphical representation of information and data. (What Is Data Visualization? Definition & Examples | Tableau, no date) This form of representation can be seen to be portrayed in visual elements such as charts, graphs, infographics, maps, etc. Furthermore, when looking at the various forms of representation of data visualisation, Li mentions that it is important to take note of them for each one of them are seen to present different visual effects, which in turn emphasises the importance when it comes to selecting the appropriate visualisation technique based on the kind of data and message one intends to bring across to the audience. (Li, 2020)</p>
          <p>Data visualisation is thereafter categorised into two common forms that is information visualisation and scientific visualisation. 
            Information visualisation focuses on how abstract data can be represented in a visual way, wherein users are able to understand the meaning of what is being portrayed which can be seen in the formats known as tables, charts, graphs, etc. 
            Whereas scientific visualisation is the graphic depiction of data as a technique of gaining knowledge and insight into scientific data, that takes the form of volume, waveforms, and simulations.
            (Li, 2020)
            </p>
          <p>From this above displayed information it has shown me the different kind of data visualisation that is found, along with in what formats they can be conducted in so that when I do further research, I am able to know what to do along with what to expect. </p>
          <p>Derieved from these two common forms we find the characteristics. When analysing the characteristic of data visualisation, Li breaks them up into three key terms such as readability which refers to the quality of it being legible, recognisability is the ability to recognise the data from previous knowledge forms and meaning being what is meant by the visual form portrayed. It is important to note that there may be more characteristics than the ones mentioned here, but these three are essential when it comes to data visualisation. </p>
          <p>Integrating data visualisation is important as it establishes value for the audience, this can be seen in the following ways:
          It makes the data easier to understand,
          Allows people who analyses data to discover trends within data, this can be over a period depending on the type of data needing to be collected. Thereafter helping you compile your information into one,
          The images displayed allows the viewers to memorise the information more.
            (Data Visualization in 2022 | The Ultimate Guide, 2022)
            </p>
          <p>Thereafter it can be used to, plan schedules, pinpoint relationships between data, help recognise trends and what outcomes can be predicted and lastly allows you to assess a situation.</p>
          <p>Data visualization serves as a link between the data and the human mind, allowing us to see patterns, trends, and anomalies that might otherwise go unnoticed if we look at them in the form of raw data. Representing this data visually it allows the viewer to understand and process the information received much easier, as someone would not read a list of facts maybe a few, however when presented visually, they will engage with it more as it is simplified along with being visually appealing to the human eye. Therefore emphasising that the way in which we portray data matters. Now looking at how this relates to the work we do, as web developers we try to ensure that our websites are easy to understand and easy to navigate through, therefore turning complex data into something simple to understand is one of the key important parts of web development. </p>
          <p>To conclude the discussion on data visualisation, it is clear to see the important role it plays in making complex data understandable. This article emphasises how important it is to make sure when portraying data that you select an appropriate method/visualisation technique linking to how as a web developer that such techniques are utilised. As we continue to navigate the big data era, data visualization is an essential tool for converting raw data into relevant insights. Furthermore it has shown me that to establish the best outcome from this, you need to know your audience, choose the right form of visualisation to display your information whilst making sure it is accessible.</p>
