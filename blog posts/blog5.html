          <h3>data visualisation, art, and representation:</h3>
          <article class="paragraph">
            <p>In the digital world we live in, the intersection of data visualisation and data art represents a compelling sequence where information meets technology. When it comes to making difficult information simpler to grasp, data visualisation is a strong tool. For Data visualization, is seen as the process through which data is represented using graphics, such charts, plots, infographics, and even animations (What is Data Visualization? | IBM, no date). On the other hand, data art gives the data an emotive component that increases its impact and engagement. As it is a form of digital art where visually appealing and meaningful representations are made using data as a medium or source material (MiMi, 2023). Furthermore, combining these two artistic disciplines creates a potent instrument for story and idea sharing.</p>
            <p>Therefore within this blog post, I will be discussing the relationship between Data Visualization and Data Art while linking it to their strategies of representation, using the knowledge achieved throughout the course along with referring to the authors, Kidd, Viegas and Roeser from our three key readings. </p>
            <p>As established in the introduction, data art and data visualization are seen to play a significant role in the digital world that we live in. However it is also important to understand the significance of representation within these two concepts. To begin, we will first be defining the terms ‘data’ and ‘representation’ then speaking on their significance in the Data Art and Data Visualization.</p>
            <p>The term ‘data’ refers to information that has been converted into a format that can be processed or moved around efficiently (What is Data? - Definition from WhatIs.com, no date). Furthermore the term ‘representation’ can be seen depicting or "making apparent" in a new way—through paintings, photos, videos, or language—something that is absent (people, places, events, or abstractions) as opposed to replicating it (representation, no date). Therefore this term representation is taken further by Kidd, for the author mentions that idea of representation is complicated by the numerous theoretical discussions that surround it which can be seen in the following five discussed by Kidd, they are:
              <li>Representation and reality </li>
              <li>Representation and myth </li>
              <li>Representation and visual culture</li>
              <li>Representation as persuasion </li>
              <li>Representation and identity politics</li>
              (Kidd, 2016)
            </p>
            <p>Now that we have established what the three key terms of the essay mean, being Data Representation, Data Visualisation and Data Art, we will be discussing this information, regarding the following points, they are:
              <li>Purpose and Functionality </li>
              <li>Design and Aesthetics </li>
              <li>Storytelling and Narrative</li>
            </p>
            <p>Purpose and Functionality:
              When it comes to the Purpose and Functionality of Data Visualization, from our past readings throughout the course, is can be seen to make it easier to identify patterns, trends, and outliers that we find in large data sets (Brush and Burns, 2022). Knaflic then takes the purpose of Data visualization one step further by discussing the importance of it in her book ‘Storytelling With Data: A Data Visualization Guide for Business Professionals’ . Within this book she examines how important it is to focus your audience’s attention by examining how people see things and how one should use it to your advantage (Knaflic, 2015). 
              </p>
            <p>In the works of Knaflic, she mentions that there are various ways in which one can portray their Data visualization, however the kind of visualisation one chooses need to grab the attention of your audience, by allowing them to focus on your visualization. This can be established by using preattentive attributes, such as colour, size, and placement, can be purposefully employed in two ways (Knaflic, 2015), these design attributes will be further touched on in the design and aesthetics section. The use of these ensures that the audience can interpret the information easily, while lessening the cognitive strains. </p>
            <p>Furthermore, in the work of Kidd, he establishes the foundation for comprehending the mutually beneficial link between the function and goal of data visualization using representation. As data visualization goes beyond just figuring out how to analyse large amounts of data in more visually appealing ways, for it is about ‘knowledge generation’ and improving the world (Kidd, 2016).</p>
            <p>Authors, Viégas and Wattenberg, mention that there is a second type of information visualisation, that has seen to flourish in the industry (Viégas and Wattenberg, 2007). This kind of information visualization is Art that is based on Data, also known as Data Art. This new form can be seen to have featured at numerous institutions, one being the Austrian Ars Electronica, in Austria. In the exhibition held, artists prioritize aesthetics above rigid usefulness, transforming raw data into visually engaging and emotionally poignant artwork. One noteworthy initiative at Ars Electronica was the use of dynamic, abstract sculptures to depict statistics on climate change. To produce visually appealing sculptures that not only communicated scientific information but also sparked emotions and spurred thought on the environmental catastrophe, the artists altered temperature and environmental data.</p>
            <p>With that Data Art is based on the visualisations of data portrayed by artists in the form of art, establishing that the artwork is based on actual received data than metaphors like your normal artists (Viégas and Wattenberg, 2007). Therefore through these works, artists aim to arouse feelings and stimulate cognition through purposeful distortion, abstraction, or reinterpretation of facts.</p>
            <p>Design and Aesthetics: 
              The next point that will be discussed is the Design and Aesthetics within these two visual representations of data. The integration of information visualization with mathematical inference to identify patterns in vast, continuously evolving information spaces is known as visual analytics, and it has recently emerged as a prominent topic within the academic visualization community (Viégas and Wattenberg, 2007). Resulting in a heightened emphasis on the design and aesthetics of these works, for they reinterpret the function of visual components, demonstrating how aesthetic concerns play a crucial part in converting unprocessed data into forms that are both visually appealing and expressive.
              </p>
            <p>The main goal of data visualization has always been to show information in an intelligible and straightforward way, such as graphs. However, with the development of data art, it is now understood that these representations' aesthetics and design are important for both information interpretation and communication, rather than only being decorative.
              The increased focus on the aesthetics and design of visual analytics represents a change in viewpoint, realizing that the visual display of data is an essential component of the analytical process as well as a tool for communication. The combination of visually appealing design and mathematical reasoning produces a synergy that improves communication, understanding, and exploration of complicated information spaces.
              </p>
            <p>Storytelling and Narrative:
              To touch on our final point for this discussion, being Storytelling and Narrative, Roeser's work adds a fascinating perspective by highlighting the value of narrative components and storytelling, especially in the context of moral considerations of technology. He then goes to speak on how an increasing number of visual artists engage with these technologies to produce art, for they allow a new array of topics one can engage with (Roeser, no date). An example of this is seen through the performance artist Stelac, who tried experimenting on his own body by utilizing surgery and cell culture, partly with his own stem cells, to implant a third ear to his arm (Roeser, no date). Furthermore exploring the borders between life and technology and creating artwork using biotechnology, as technology is becoming increasingly prominent in the world, we live in. Through this artwork composed by Stelac we can see how narrative elements can be displayed, such as  seeing that the story goes deeper than just the actual act of implantation,  for it is about exploring the changing dynamic between technology and people.
              </p>
            <p>Although Stelac's artwork reflects our desire to use technology to expand our lives, it also poses concerns about the potential negative effects of doing so. It pushes us to think carefully about the effects of the decisions we make and to contemplate the moral standards we ought to establish to safeguard our future.</p>
            <p>To conclude, from the above information, it is clear to see the intersection of information, technology, and creativity in the digital era is marked by the substantial interaction between Data Visualization and Data Art. As discussed in the related broken-down topics above, it is clear to see that representation also plays a vital part, for it can be seen everywhere within these works of art.</p>
