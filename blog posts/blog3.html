          <h3>interaction for data visualisation </h3>
          <article class="paragraph">
            <p>As we know the intricate relationship of design, technology, and data has created a world full of engaging digital experiences, hence where Data Visualisation comes into play. As we know, Data Visualisation involves putting information into a visual form, such as a map, graph, etc. therefore making it easier for humans to grasp and draw conclusions from for it is easier to see trends, patterns, and outlines in these data sets. (Brush and Burns, 2022) 
            </p>
            <p>However with this in mind it is essential to take note of the interactions that occurs within this concept. Moreso, with the above information mentioned we will be looking at an article written by Dimara and Perin ‘What is Interaction for Data Visualisation’ (Dimara and Perin, 2020) while reflecting on the core concepts discussed along with any additional information.   
            </p>
            <p>To begin, let us start by defining what is interaction in terms of data visualisation. As mentioned before Data Visualisation deals with the format through which different kinds of data can be represented visually, with that in mind, interactive data visualisation is the process of creating a visual representation of data that can be examined and evaluated directly within the visualization itself,  an example of this can be seen as hover features over a bar graph that shows the value of it instead of having all the values display on the screen which  as established by Knaflic that “clutter is our enemy” (Knaflic, 2015).
            </p>
            <p>Before diving further into the critical reflection of the reading, here are a few points that I will be using as a guide to help me, they can be seen as the following:
            <li>Historical context of Data Visualization</li>
            <li>The role of Interaction in Data Visualization</li>
            <li>Cognitive Implications</li>
            <li>Tools and Techniques used</li>
            <li>Personal experience and reflection</li></p>
            <p>When we look at the history of data visualisation it can be seen to date back to the 17th century, where it was used in maps to display land markers, roads, cities, etc. therefore overtime as the demand grew for the various mappings it resulted in the need better visualisations. (insightsoftware, 2023) Which when we look at current times it can still be seen to utilise maps along with other visual forms.</p>
            <p>Moving on to our main point that is seen to be brought across in the article and what it is we need to reflect upon is the role of Interaction in Data Visualisation. In the article Dimara and Perin make it known that Data Visualization depends on Interaction, yet the definition of “interaction” in this context is vague and difficult to understand. Through which they mention further that the term is seen to be “exclusive and overloaded” (Dimara and Perin, 2020) With this form of interaction in place, there are a lot of benefits that come from it along with how it can be seen to transform the viewers experience for when they engage with the data.</p>
        <p>Examples of this include:
            <li>Identifying Trends in data better – for the human brain is seen to process graphics faster than text as it is more appealing. </li>
        <li>Identifying Relationships more effectively – wherein users can find previously unnoticed cause-and-effect linkages over defined durations by being able to closely focus on parameters.</li>
        <li>Simplifying complex data – as we have simplified it, it makes it easier to understand, manage and interpret than having a lager data set wherein all the information displayed is chaotic causing you to not get clear insights.  </li>
        <li>Using Data Storytelling – by giving several perspectives on the data, a visual data narrative that allows users to zoom in and out, highlight important information, filter, and adjust the parameters encourages better comprehension of the data.</li>(What is Interactive Data Visualization?, no date)</p>
        <p>Furthermore, in active, human-driven data exploration where the user oversees the information space, it is increasingly seen to be a way to enhance cognition.(Dimara and Perin, 2020) For users are able to better comprehend the underlying patterns and correlations by actively studying the data, which enables them to make more educated decisions. Additionally, as users are compelled to think critically and creatively to discover insights, it is a useful method for improving problem-solving abilities.</p>
            <p>
                With displaying great interactivity amongst Data it is crucial to use the appropriate tools and techniques to help users explore it better. Here are some of the typical data visualization interactions that can aid consumers in exploring your data visualizations, we will be looking at the 3 main types, they are:
                <li>Brushing – this technique allows you as the user to change the colour of your plot in which your data is displayed by tracing a line around the points or acting as a pointer.</li>
                <li>Scaling – allows the aspect ratio of the plot to change as various data features are revealed. </li>
                <li>Linking – joins together certain story points from many stories, thus linking to our point mentioned in the roles of data visualization. Therefore. when a plot is brushed, all cases in the relevant category on all other plots are also brushed.</li>
                (What is Interactive Data Visualization?, no date)
            </p>
            <p>With all mentioned in mind, when it comes to my personal thoughts, it is clear to see the complexities when it comes to stating what interaction is for Data visualization for it goes beyond the stuff mentioned as well. Therefore integrating interaction within Data Visualization is seen as a crucial as it is what captures your audience through these small aspects. Which emphasises the point brought across by Dimara and Perin for they mention that the interaction between a person and a data interface for visualization involves at least one action from the person, a perceived data-related response from the interface, and interaction for visualization. (Dimara and Perin, 2020) Through engagement, the audience can better grasp the data and acquire insights that would not be available without contact. Additionally, it raises engagement and motivates viewers to connect with the data more. An interactive graph, for instance, may be changed to display various data points and provide viewers a broader understanding of the data.</p>
            <p>In conclusion, we can see that data is not just about interaction with users and the data itself, but also about enrichment and engagement. In the era of data-driven decision-making, it is crucial to make sure that data is not only viewed but also comprehended. This essay rightly emphasizes that interaction is a powerful tool for achieving that objective. Instead of merely reporting facts, data visualization strives to reveal the stories and patterns hidden in the data. As a result, this revealing becomes a two-way trip between data and observer through interactivity. All in all, data visualization helps to make data more meaningful and understandable, thus enabling better decision-making. </p>
